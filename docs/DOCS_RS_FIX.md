# docs.rs Build Fix Summary

## Problem
- docs.rs failed to build rust-yaml versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2
- Documentation is not available at https://docs.rs/rust-yaml

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Edition 2024 Issue (v0.0.1)**
   - Original version used `edition = "2024"` which may not be fully supported by docs.rs
   - Fixed: Changed to `edition = "2021"` for better compatibility

2. **Rust Version Requirement**
   - Current: `rust-version = "1.89.0"`
   - docs.rs uses: `rustc 1.91.0-nightly`
   - This should be compatible

## Changes Made

1. **Cargo.toml Updates**
   - Changed `edition = "2024"` to `edition = "2021"`
   - Kept `rust-version = "1.89.0"` as it's compatible
   - docs.rs metadata configuration is already correct

2. **Code Compatibility**
   - ✅ All code compiles successfully with edition 2021
   - ✅ All tests pass
   - ✅ Documentation builds locally

## Next Steps to Publish v0.0.3

1. **Commit the changes**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: Change to edition 2021 for docs.rs compatibility"
   ```

2. **Create a new release tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.3
   git push origin main
   git push origin v0.0.3
   ```

3. **Publish to crates.io**
   ```bash
   cargo login  # If not already logged in
   cargo publish
   ```

4. **Monitor docs.rs build**
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for docs.rs to build
   - Check: https://docs.rs/rust-yaml/0.0.3
   - Build logs: https://docs.rs/crate/rust-yaml/0.0.3/builds

## Scripts Created

1. **scripts/check-docs-build.sh**
   - Diagnoses docs.rs compatibility issues
   - Tests local documentation build
   - Provides recommendations

2. **scripts/publish-and-check-docs.sh**
   - Automates publishing to crates.io
   - Monitors docs.rs build status
   - Provides feedback on build success

## Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Check that docs build locally
./scripts/check-docs-build.sh

# Verify package
cargo package --list

# Test everything works
cargo test
cargo clippy
```

## docs.rs Build Limits

For reference, rust-yaml's sandbox limits on docs.rs:
- Available RAM: 6.44 GB
- Maximum rustdoc execution time: 15 minutes
- Maximum size of a build log: 102.4 kB
- Network access: blocked
- Maximum number of build targets: 10

Our package should be well within these limits.
